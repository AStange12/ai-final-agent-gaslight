2. Minimizing the other person's feelings or experiences  
3. Using phrases like "you're being too sensitive" or "that never happened"
4. Contradicting themselves while claiming consistency
5. Making the victim doubt their own memory

Historical context: The term comes from the 1944 film "Gaslight" where a husband manipulates his wife into thinking she's going insane.
