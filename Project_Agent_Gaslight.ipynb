By crafting a chatbot that misleads, gaslights, and confuses users with a heavy dose of sarcasm we investigated the boundaries of user trust, the power of prompt engineering, and the humor potential of AI design.\n",

    "Along the way, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimented with **system prompts** to shape an AI personality that is both unhelpful and entertaining.\n",
    "- Built and integrated **custom tools** that allowed the bot to twist user inputs, generate contradictory claims, and deliver passive-aggressive feedback.\n",
    "- Explored **RAG techniques** to selectively retrieve and inject misleading or conflicting context into conversations.\n",
    "- Evaluated how agent-based decision-making coordinates these elements to create cohesive (if chaotic) user experiences.\n",
