    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the development of a deliberately adversarial AI agent as a playful yet educational exploration of agentic workflows, system prompting, tool integration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By crafting a chatbot that misleads, gaslights, and confuses users with a heavy dose of sarcasm we investigated the boundaries of user trust, the power of prompt engineering, and the humor potential of AI design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimented with **system prompts** to shape an AI personality that is both unhelpful and entertaining.\n",
    "- Built and integrated **custom tools** that allowed the bot to twist user inputs, generate contradictory claims, and deliver passive-aggressive feedback.\n",
    "- Explored **RAG techniques** to selectively retrieve and inject misleading or conflicting context into conversations.\n",
    "- Evaluated how agent-based decision-making coordinates these elements to create cohesive (if chaotic) user experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the tone of the bot is intentionally mischievous, the broader goal was to demonstrate how LLM-powered agents can be controlled, customized, and pushed to creative extremes, both as a learning exercise and a launchpad for future AI work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🤖 **Why it matters:**  \n",
    "> This project isn't just a joke (though it is pretty funny), it offers a hands-on, curiosity-driven way to explore critical design choices in modern AI systems. By going against the grain of helpful assistants, we gain insight into how and why they succeed… or fail.\n",
